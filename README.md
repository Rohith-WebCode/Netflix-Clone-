Netflix-Clone


Developed a fully responsive Netflix Clone application using React.js to replicate the user experience of the popular streaming service. The project includes the following features:

Dynamic Content Rendering: Integrated TMDb API to fetch and display real-time data on movies and TV shows, including posters, descriptions, and trailers.

User Interface: Designed a sleek and intuitive UI with React, mimicking Netflixâ€™s grid layout, carousel sliders, and hover effects for a visually appealing experience.

Responsive Design: Ensured the application is fully responsive, providing an optimized viewing experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

State Management: Utilized React Hooks and Context API for efficient state management, ensuring smooth navigation and seamless user interaction.
Media Streaming: Integrated video streaming functionality, allowing users to preview trailers directly within the app.

This project provided hands-on experience with API integration, component-based architecture, and strengthening my skills in front-end development.
